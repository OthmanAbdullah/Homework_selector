<h3><em>About the script:</em> </h3>
A simple, handy python script that is utilized to help the <strong><em> Functional Programming Demonstrators</em></strong> to distribute the created homeworks/tasks into
10 variations of homework, as every student gets 2 questions in each homework, and each  demonstrator of the course creates 2 questions, the 
script distributes all the collected tasks from the demonstrators and creates 10 variant homeworks from the collected tasks based on some distribution restrictions.  

<h3><em>Tools used for the script:</em> </h3>
The script was written in python programming language

<h3><em>Goal from the poject:</em> </h3>
